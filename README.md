# Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of an Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, demonstrating secure user authentication, role assignment, and access control based on roles. It showcases fundamental security practices, ensuring only authorized users can access certain resources depending on their roles.
## Key Features:
### Authentication:
Secure user registration, login, and logout.
Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
### Authorization:
Access to protected resources is controlled based on user roles.
Roles include Admin, User, and Moderator.
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Specific permissions are assigned to roles.
Example:
### Admin: 
Full access to all resources (e.g., create, read, update, delete users).
### User: 
Limited access to personal resources (e.g., view profile).
### Moderator: 
Partial administrative privileges (e.g., manage specific resources).
### Token-Based Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure session management.
Tokens are used to verify user identity and access rights.
### RESTful API:
Built using Node.js and Express.js.
API endpoints for managing users, roles, and permissions.
### Database Integration:
MongoDB is used as the database to store user data and roles.
Data is modeled using Mongoose.
### Secure Practices:
Input validation using Joi to prevent invalid data submissions.
Error handling for invalid tokens, unauthorized access, and non-existent resources.
## Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token), bcrypt
Validation: Joi
Environment Variables: dotenv
Tools: Postman for API testing
## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Install Node.js.
Install MongoDB.
## API Endpoints
### Authentication Routes
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate a user and issue a token.
### User Routes
GET /api/users: Retrieve a list of all users (Admin-only).
GET /api/users/:id: Retrieve details of a specific user (Admin/Moderator).
PUT /api/users/:id: Update user details (Admin/Moderator).
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user (Admin-only).
### RBAC Middleware
Protects routes by verifying user roles.
Examples:
Admin can access /api/users.
Users can only access their profile.
## How It Works
### Authentication
User registration:
Email and password are required.
Password is hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
User login:
Verifies email and password.
Issues a JWT token if credentials are valid.
### Authorization
JWT tokens:
Tokens include user information like their ID and role.
Tokens are validated for each request to protected routes.
Middleware:
authMiddleware.js: Verifies if the user is authenticated.
roleMiddleware.js: Checks the userâ€™s role for specific endpoints.
### RBAC Implementation
User roles:
Roles like Admin, User, and Moderator are assigned during user creation or update.
Access control:
Role-based middleware ensures that only users with specific roles can access certain routes.
## Future Enhancements
Add front-end integration with React or Vue.js.
Implement OAuth for third-party authentication.
Add support for hierarchical roles (e.g., Manager > Employee).
Improve security with refresh tokens.
